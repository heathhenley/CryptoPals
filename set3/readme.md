# Challenge 21 

Jumping to this challenge because it seems that understanding MT19937 and how
works under the hood might help me with another crypto challenge I'm working on
right now. Specifically need a good understanding of how state is related to
the seed, etc.

Not matching Python implementation for the same seed, not sure if it's because
it's implemented differently or if I'm doing something wrong, going to look
into it more...

Giving us random (looking) numbers though, so that's cool!
