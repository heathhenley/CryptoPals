# Cryptopals Challenges

These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).

Working through these to learn a little bit about cryptography and
common attacks, been pretty fun so far!

To run these, you might need to install the requirements in the
requirements.txt file. I've been using Python 3.11.

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
should install them for you. If you want to use a virtual environment,
you can do that too.

```
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
So that you can install them locally and keep them separate from your
global packages.
